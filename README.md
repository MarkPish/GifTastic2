# GifTastic2


In this assignment, we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice. I choose birds as my topic.

Instructions:

Enter a bird type into the search box. As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear below with the bird type entered and 10 gifs related to that term will appear below. The rating of g or pg will appear next to the still gifs of the bird selected.

Clicking on the still gif image will animate the gif, clicking again will return the gif to its still form.
